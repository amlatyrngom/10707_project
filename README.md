# Object detection model
This folder contains a minimal set of files to reduce the submission size. The following steps are need to rebuild the project and test the model.

## 0. Setup the third party detection library
Download https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-YOLOv3/.
Make sure to choose the commit with id *96d0208* to ensure compatibility with my code.
Then move the *gen_caption_data.py* file into the *Pytorch-YOLOv3/* folder. 

## 1. Generating the training data
The training data was removed to reduce the size of the folder, so make sure to download the Flickr8k dataset and place it in the current directory.
. The training features can then be generated by executing the following code.

```sh
# Generate image features
python prep_img.py
# Generate caption features
python prep_txt.py
# Generate the tokenizer
python gen_tokenizer.py

# Generate object detection data
# First cd into the detection library
cd PyTorch-YOLOv3
# Generate pickle files containing the data
python gen_caption_data.py --gen_data train --image_folder <path_to_flicker_images>
# Move them to the main directory
mv *.pkl ..
cd ..
```

## 2. Training
Simply run
```sh
python train.py
```
The models will then be saved into the **models/** folder.
## 3. Getting BLEU scores
```sh
python eval.py <path_to_best_model>
```

## 4. Generating caption
```sh
# Generate pickle files containing the test caption
cd PyTorch-YOLOv3
python gen_caption_data.py --gen_data test --image_folder <path_to_test_image_folder>
mv *.pkl ..
cd ..

python gen_caption.py <path_to_test_image>
```
